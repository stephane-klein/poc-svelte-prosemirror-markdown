I copied the source code of <https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-markdown> into this folder
so that I could modify (`tight: {default: false}` => `tight: {default: true}`) the schema file settings.

I haven't found a solution to modify this configuration by
importing the `prosemirror-markdown` package.

If you have a solution, please don't hesitate to share it with me at <contact@stephane-klein.info>.
